## Canada Rental Price Prediction - Regression Model Project

This project aims at analyzing the latest data regarding **Canada Rental Price in 2024** and, most importantly, finding the best machine learning model (regression model) to make the most accurate predictions on the rental price.

Project Co-Created by: 
Kun Bi, Naudeen Stewart, Flora Wong (Yuen Ling)

Dataset: [dataset](canada_rent.csv)
Dataset obtained from: [rentfaster.ca](https://www.rentfaster.ca/?utm_source=OOH&utm_medium=sign&utm_campaign=ca).


## Questions to be explored
1. What are the relationships between each factor and the rental price? 
2. Which factors (or features) are important in influencing the rental price?
3. How are the performances of multiple regression models?
4. Which regression model is the best model based on statistical anaysis?
5. Make New Prediction on Rental Price
